From http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/f_src/toeplitz/toeplitz.html :
"TOEPLITZ is a FORTRAN90 library which solves a variety of Toeplitz and circulant linear systems.
The package can also handle circulant Toeplitz systems, and some other more complicated but related forms.
The TOEPLITZ package was written in the early 1980's by a joint working group of American and Soviet mathematicians.
The original, true, correct version of TOEPLITZ is available in the TOEPLITZ subdirectory of the NETLIB web site."

toeplitz.f90 was written by John Burkardt and is distributed under GNU LGPL license.
It can be obtained from the cited website page.

This wrapper is based on numpy/f2py and provides a python interface for all
fortran subroutines *_sl. Only the functions sto_sl and cto_sl (solve linear
Toeplitz systems) are tested. They provide acceptable accuracy compared to
scipy.linalg, but should run faster. All other routines are not testet,
but should work.
For documentation check the source file toeplitz.f90 or for a short version the
cited website.

installation:
    python setup.py install
